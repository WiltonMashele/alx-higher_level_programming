How to Use the matrix_divided Function
==============================

This file provides a Python module, "2-matrix_divided.py," which includes the function `matrix_divided(matrix, div)` for dividing a matrix.

Usage
=====

The `matrix_divided(matrix, div)` function returns a new matrix that is a copy of the parameter `matrix`, with all elements divided by `div`.

Example:

```python
>>> from 2-matrix_divided import matrix_divided

>>> matrix = [
...     [3, 6, 9],
...     [12, 15, 18]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

Note that the quotients are rounded to a maximum of two decimal places.

>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 2, 3],
...     [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

The original matrix remains unchanged.

>>> print(matrix)
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

The function supports both integers and floating-point numbers in the matrix.

>>> matrix = [
...     [1.1, -2.2, 3.3],
...     [4.4, 5.5, -6.6]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[0.37, -0.73, 1.1], [1.47, 1.83, -2.2]]

However, an empty list of lists will not raise an error.

>>> matrix = [
...     [1, -2.2, 3, 4.4, 5],
...     [-6.6, 7.00, 8, 9.999, 10]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[0.33, -0.73, 1.0, 1.47, 1.67], [-2.2, 2.33, 2.67, 3.33, 3.33]]

The same TypeError is raised if matrix is not specifically a list of lists.

>>> matrix = "not a list"
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

The same TypeError is raised if any elements in matrix are neither integers nor floats.

>>> matrix = None
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Finally, all the rows in matrix must have the same size. If any rows are of different sizes, a new TypeError is raised.

>>> matrix = []
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Invalid Divisors
================

The parameter div must be either an integer or a float. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.

>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 2, 3],
...     [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "not a number"))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  TypeError: div must be a number

>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, None))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  TypeError: div must be a number

div must also be non-zero. Otherwise, a ZeroDivisionError is raised.

>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
